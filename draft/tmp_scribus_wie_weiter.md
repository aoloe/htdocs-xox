ideas from the pre-xmas-discussion with claudia

- modular / bausteine system
- small apps that can talk together and create a workflow (like tools and pipes in unix)
- a program based on browser technologies (chrome or firefox?) -> like pencil


DTP will always be needed for thinks like art books with many pictures
but can we objectively reach the quality needed for that type of users?

with the shift away from offset technologies towards laser printing, the question is if a "real" DTP tool is still needed or if basing on what HTML+CSS offers is good enough.
do we need Scribus for a parish newsletter? for a bridge clup results magazine?

the production is more and more shifting to publishing to the web: shouldn't a "publishing" tool first target the screen, with fluid design options?
