Jean-Luc made me aware of this proposal for the OpenOffice UI

And yes: it looks very much like what we would need for our Properties palette!

Il like it. But i would prefert to make sure that we don't rely on the "collapsability" of the widgets...

Nothing against having the items collapsable; if somebody wants optimize his own view, but we should not rely on it for the basic usability: on a normal monitor we should see everything we need without further click.

Now the big question: should we start a git branch with two new plugins, with the UI for the Content and the Container palettes? Then when Jean is over with his refactoring, we could link the real Scribus code to the new palettes!
