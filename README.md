htdocs-xox
==========

This is a try to get my xox.ch website managed through github.

The goal is to serve xox.ch with static HTML and PHP, while being able to edit the content both online
(through github's online editor) and offline (and then committed to github as I'm online again).

One big limitation is that I don't have git installed on the server and that there seem to be no (simple)
way to do a git commit / push with pure PHP (and I don't have access to other languages than PHP)
