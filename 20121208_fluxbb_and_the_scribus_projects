i'm working on a project where i'm using fluxbb as a base...

... what i'm creating is not a forum, but i can't find any type of software better suited than a forum.

the idea is to create a platform where several people can work together on specifications, while getting feedback from the community.
the feedback probably being the most important part.

currently, i've chosen fluxbb as a base, because it's the only forum i've found that does not look like a circus...
... and somehow meets many of the needs i have.

the project is currently here
http://graphicslab.org/scribus/project/
it's not public yet, but you can see in what direction it's heading.

now. there are some key features that i need and i wonder if it makes sense to work with you and get them integrated into fluxbb or if it's better if i start my own project.

some of the features are:
- rich text (editor) for the topic. most of all i need to be able to attach images to it and show them in the frame. bb code does not work, it should be wysiwyg
- attach files to the topic
- hiding (not deleting) the comments that have been integrated into the topic
- attaching tags to the topics (and letting the people look for tags)
- moderate comments (only shown once accepted)
- custom main page.
- in the list of the topics it should be possible to add a description of each topic

voil√†... i think that are about my need that are not (well) covered by fluxbb...
so the question: where i can discuss about it? is there any chance to work with you to get them in?
(ah, something else: i need a way to manage the install of fluxbb as i have it... manually applying patches is probably a bad way to work, since it's too hard to keep the code up to date)

an alternative way of handling this:
- create a git(hub) repository with the list of the projects descriptions. one file per project.
  - markdown or html
  - upload images and attachments in the git repository
- create a web interface that shows the list of the projects and shows its details.
- create/find a comments system that can be linked to each project
  - comments without being registered
  - filter by ip, eventually with captcha
  - only text + links (images linked are automatically shown?)
  - comments are moderated with an email notification
  - accept / remove a comment through link in email
  - comments can be hidden (when they have been integrated into the project description)
  - there are users (no moderation) and editors / administrators (moderation / delete / hide).
